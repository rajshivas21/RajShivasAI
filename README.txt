RajShivas AI - Base Project (Minimal)

What's included:
- Minimal Android app (Kotlin) with:
  * Welcome screen (black/gold theme)
  * Shivas Mode switch (placeholder)
  * TextToSpeech voice greet
  * AI Guide placeholder screen

How to build:
Option A (Recommended - PC):
 1. Install Android Studio (latest).
 2. File -> New -> Import Project -> select the extracted folder.
 3. Let Gradle sync, then Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s).

Option B (On-phone using AIDE app):
 1. Install 'AIDE' (Android IDE) from Play Store.
 2. Create a new Android project (Kotlin).
 3. Replace app files with the ones from this package (manually create files in AIDE).
 4. Build and install the APK from the AIDE interface.

Notes & Next steps:
- This is a starter scaffold. Next steps I can do right away:
  * Add voice recognition & real-time earphone assistance integration.
  * Integrate a small local fallback model, or remote OpenAI endpoint (with your API key).
  * Add video-editing shortcuts (calls to installed editors) and template system.
  * Build an admin panel and in-app payment flow.

If you want, tell me:
 - Do you want me to integrate OpenAI-based chat (you'll provide API key)?
 - Do you want the APK built and emailed to hihimalya@gmail.com?
